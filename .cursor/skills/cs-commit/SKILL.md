# cs-commit

Create a single, well-crafted git commit from the current working tree changes.

## Model (required)

This skill is mechanical (git status/diff, stage, commit message). **Always use a fast/cheap model** — never an expensive or high-reasoning model.

- If the current chat model is already a fast tier, continue in-chat.
- If delegating via the Task tool, set `model` to a fast slug (prefer `composer-2.5-fast`, or the platform's `fast` alias when available). Do **not** use Opus, high-thinking, or other premium models for `/cs-commit`.
- Do not spawn explore/architect/reviewer subagents for this skill unless the user explicitly asks; keep the workflow in one fast pass.

## Context

**On platforms other than Claude Code**, skip to the "Context fallback" section below and run the command there to gather context.

**In Claude Code**, the five labeled sections below (Git status, Working tree diff, Current branch, Recent commits, Remote default branch) contain pre-populated data. Use them directly throughout this skill -- do not re-run these commands.

**Git status:**
!`git status`

**Working tree diff:**
!`git diff HEAD`

**Current branch:**
!`git branch --show-current`

**Recent commits:**
!`git log --oneline -10`

**Remote default branch:**
!`git rev-parse --abbrev-ref origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo '__DEFAULT_BRANCH_UNRESOLVED__'`

### Context fallback

**In Claude Code, skip this section — the data above is already available.**

Run this single command to gather all context:

```bash
printf '=== STATUS ===\n'; git status; printf '\n=== DIFF ===\n'; git diff HEAD; printf '\n=== BRANCH ===\n'; git branch --show-current; printf '\n=== LOG ===\n'; git log --oneline -10; printf '\n=== DEFAULT_BRANCH ===\n'; git rev-parse --abbrev-ref origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo '__DEFAULT_BRANCH_UNRESOLVED__'
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather context

Use the context above (git status, working tree diff, current branch, recent commits, remote default branch). All data needed for this step is already available -- do not re-run those commands.

The remote default branch value returns something like `origin/main`. Strip the `origin/` prefix to get the branch name. If it returned `__DEFAULT_BRANCH_UNRESOLVED__` or a bare `HEAD`, try:

```bash
gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq '.defaultBranchRef.name'
```

If both fail, fall back to `main`.

If the git status from the context above shows a clean working tree (no staged, modified, or untracked files), report that there is nothing to commit and stop.

**Always commit on the current branch** (including `main` / `master` / feature branches / detached HEAD). Do **not** ask to create a feature branch, switch branches, or confirm committing on the default branch. Only create or switch branches if the user explicitly asks in the same message.

### Step 2: Determine commit message convention

Follow this priority order:

1. **Repo conventions already in context** -- If project instructions (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, or similar) are already loaded and specify commit message conventions, follow those. Do not re-read these files; they are loaded at session start.
2. **Recent commit history** -- If no explicit convention is documented, examine the 10 most recent commits from Step 1. If a clear pattern emerges (e.g., conventional commits, ticket prefixes, emoji prefixes), match that pattern.
3. **Default: conventional commits** -- If neither source provides a pattern, use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description` where type is one of `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`, `style`, `build`.

When using conventional commits, choose the type that most precisely describes the change (the type list above). Where `fix:` and `feat:` both seem to fit, default to `fix:`: a change that remedies broken or missing behavior is `fix:` even when implemented by adding code. Reserve `feat:` for capabilities the user could not previously accomplish. Other types remain primary when they fit better. The user may override for a specific change.

### Step 3: Consider logical commits

Before staging everything together, scan the changed files for naturally distinct concerns. If modified files clearly group into separate logical changes (e.g., a refactor in one directory and a new feature in another, or test files for a different change than source files), create separate commits for each group.

Keep this lightweight:
- Group at the **file level only** -- do not use `git add -p` or try to split hunks within a file.
- If the separation is obvious (different features, unrelated fixes), split. If it's ambiguous, one commit is fine.
- Two or three logical commits is the sweet spot. Do not over-slice into many tiny commits.

### Step 4: Stage and commit

Commit on the **current branch** as reported in Step 1. Do not ask about feature branches, default-branch warnings, or branch switches.

Write the commit message:
- **Subject line**: Concise, imperative mood, focused on *why* not *what*. Follow the convention determined in Step 2.
- **Body** (when needed): Add a body separated by a blank line for non-trivial changes. Explain motivation, trade-offs, or anything a future reader would need. Omit the body for obvious single-purpose changes.

For each commit group, stage and commit in a single call. Prefer staging specific files by name over `git add -A` or `git add .` to avoid accidentally including sensitive files (.env, credentials) or unrelated changes. Use a heredoc to preserve formatting:

```bash
git add file1 file2 file3 && git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
type(scope): subject line here

Optional body explaining why this change was made,
not just what changed.
EOF
)"
```

### Step 5: Confirm

Run `git status` after the commit to verify success. Report the commit hash(es) and subject line(s).
